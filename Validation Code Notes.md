Validation Code Notes 

What it does
NER Validation: Evaluates a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model using precision, recall, and F1-score.
Privacy Metric: Calculates a simple proxy for re-identification risk based on the uniqueness of PII columns.
Data Utility Metric: Measures how well non-PII columns are preserved after processing.

Requirements
Dependencies: You need Python, pandas, and scikit-learn installed. For NER, you'll need a compatible NLP library (like spaCy) and a trained model passed as nlp.
Inputs: The code expects CSV files named your_dataset.csv and processed_dataset.csv with appropriate columns.

Usability Review
The functions are well-defined and can be imported into other scripts.
The NER validation assumes your true_labels are lists of (start, end, label) tuples for each text.
The privacy metric is a simple proxy; for more sensitive applications, more advanced methods are suggested.
The utility metric checks categorical column preservation, which is reasonable for simple tabular data.

To Use This Script
Ensure your data files exist and have the correct columns.
Replace column names in the sample usage section with those matching your dataset.
Provide a trained NER model (e.g., spaCy) for validate_ner.
